SLICOT SOURCE CODE
------------------

In this directory are the source files for SLICOT, as distributed by
[SLICOT.ORG](http://slicot.org/). Some of the contents of this directory
have been modified for use with Julia. These modifications are as follows:

1. Modified makefiles for compilation into a shared library
2. An alternative implementation of XERBLA.f that doesn't do anything,
allowing Julia to handle all errors
3. Removal of examples and documentation. To access these, you may
download them [here](http://slicot.org/the-control-and-systems-library-slicot/source-archives)

For more information, see the original readme (included), or the SLICOT
[website](http://slicot.org/).
